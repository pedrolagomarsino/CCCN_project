Reinforcement learning as a model for the dopaminergic system

Construct a RL model, perhaps inspired by extant work in the field (e.g., Lak et
al., 2017; Rao, 2010) that you think can explain the observed behavioural and
neural phenomena, and perhaps make additional interesting predictions. The
model can be as biological/non-biological as you like, though it may be easier
to start at a more abstract, algorithmic level.
